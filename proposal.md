Title of the talk : Inflation forecasting model 

Name(s): Animesh Kumar Jha, Sarthak Chauhan, Abhiraj Rana.

A brief description of the research topic, including some background and why it is important and what we know/donâ€™t know about it (knowledge gap): The model that we aim to create is to predict the inflation rates of United States using a dataset that provides the necessary values, as the inflation rate has been skyrocketing in the past few months, it has become necessary for everyone to budget their finanaces for present and future. Knowledge gap would be about the dataset and which variables most affect the prediction system. Which model will best fit the dataset and provide the best accuracy for prediction.

A brief description of the data required, and how would you get such data: The dataset should contain data like previous inflation rate, median household income in US, monthly average mortage intrest rate, consumer price index, producer price index, consumer confidence, monthly home supplies, gdp. To get this type of data we need to scour the economic datasets that we can find online or through readings. 

A list of questions and corresponding analysis tasks you plan to do: 
Motivation to select this topic. 
how will employment get effected?
find out about Socio-Economic issues related to this data.
Trying and choosing best model type with the most accuracy so that we can predict inflation data with confidence and better prepare for the future.
Using the best predictors from the choosen dataset for least error in the model.
