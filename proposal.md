Title of the talk : Inflation forecasting model

A brief description of the research topic, including some background and why it is important and what we know/donâ€™t know about it (knowledge gap): In the field of economics, inflation refers to an overall rise in the cost of goods and services throughout a nation. Each unit of currency may purchase fewer products and services as the overall price level rises, hence inflation is associated with a decline in the buying power of money. Inflation can be measured using the "Consumer Price Index (CPI)," which calculates the percentage change in the cost of a selection of products and services that households use, is the most well-known measure of inflation. The model that we aim to create is to predict the inflation rates for United States using a dataset that provides the necessary values, as the inflation rate has been skyrocketing in the past few months, it has become necessary for everyone to budget their finanaces for present and future. Similar studies have been done on a global scale or for specifically a single country such as Brazil in the survey paper we reviwed. 

Knowledge gap would be about the dataset and which variables most affect the prediction system. Which model will best fit the dataset and provide the best accuracy for prediction.

A brief description of the data required, and how would you get such data: The dataset should contain data like previous inflation rate, median household income in US, monthly average mortage intrest rate, consumer price index, producer price index, consumer confidence, monthly home supplies, gdp. To get this type of data we need to scour the economic datasets that we can find online or through readings.

A list of questions and corresponding analysis tasks you plan to do: 
Motivation to select this topic. 
"find out about Socio-Economic issues related to this data."
Trying and choosing best model type with the most accuracy so that we can predict inflation data with confidence and better prepare for the future.
Using the best predictors from the choosen dataset for least error in the model.
Analysis methods to predict future inflation rate, that we would compare are lasso regression, elastic net word cloud, vector regression, quantile regression forest, random forest, empirical analysis model, on the basis of their accuracy, Residual Sum of Squares, R-Squared, Residual Standard Error, and bias-varience trade-off.
