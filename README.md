# Project Overview

## What does the project do?
### The project is a machine learning model that is used to predict inflation data. Machine Learning algorithms linear regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ridge Regression are compared to find the most optimal algorithm providing accurate inflation rates and patterns.

## Why the project is useful?
### The ability to predict future inflation can provide the opportunity to better prepare financially. The use of machine learning to optimally predict the value can help trust the prediction of the model.

## How users can get started with the project
### Anyone who wishes to work on this project can download the dataset and the code from the repo to further work on this model and create improvements. 

## Where users can get help with your project 
### If anyone has doubts regarding the model and needs clarification they can send an email to - animeshkumarjha@arizona.edu or sarthakchauhan@arizona.edu

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
### Animesh Kumar Jha, Sarthak Chauhan, and Abhiraj Rana (Graduate students at the University of Arizona) maintain and contribute to the project.
