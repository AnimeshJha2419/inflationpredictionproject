# Project Overview



## What the project does?
### The project is a machine learning model that is used to predict inflation data. Machine Learning algorithms linear regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ridge Regression are compared to find the most optimal algorithm providing accrate inflation rates and patterns.

## Why the project is useful?
### The ability to predict future inflation can provide the opportunity to better prepare financially. The use of machine learning to optimally predict the value can help trust the prediction of the model.

## How users can get started with the project
### Anyone who wishes to work on this project can download the dataset and the code from the repo to furthur work on this model and create improvements. 

## Where users can get help with your project 
### If anyone has doubts regarding the model and needs clarification they can send a mail to - sarthakchauhan@arizona.edu

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
### As part of our final project for Machine Learning class the group members- Animesh Kumar Jha, Sarthak Chauhan, and Abhiraj Rana (students of University of Arizona) maintain and contribute to the project.
