## Instructions

You report should be a short summary of your project progress. This report is relevant to to us, your instructors, and probably to the rest of the class.

Please use this report as a chance to organize your thoughts about what you are trying to do with your project, and to get feedback on your ideas, and the approaches that you have tried so far.

## Submission

Please commit this file to your GitHub repo (progress.md) AND to D2L.

### GitHub repo usage
Currently we have updated our proposal for the project to our github repo. We have commited twice to the repo and have updated our proposal once, to better suit the structure provided by our instructor.
Although we haven't uploaded any code for our final project, however we have uploaded the dataset for our final project that would be utilized during our prediction analysis.



### Summarize your data




### Describe your initial analysis strategy
We began with preprocessing our data by tuning parameters and removing the data inconsistencies within the dataset, to select the best accuracy, Residual Sum of Squares, R-Squared, Residual Standard Error, and bias-varience trade-off,
we are implementing forward selection while applying the random forest algorithm to select the best subset that we can find. We are also currently applying the same algorithm with vector regression and quantile regression forest
