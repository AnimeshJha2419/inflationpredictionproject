Project: Detection and Visualization of Earthquake Data with respect to Tectonic Plates Names (https://github.com/ISTA421INFO521/final-project-Shanmuganathan98)
Name: Sarthak Chauhan

## Provide a brief description of the project
The goal of the project is to visualize and detect earthquakes with respect to continent, tectonic plate, and country in order to determine the coordinates of the epicentre and identify earthquake-prone areas. In order to estimate the magnitude of the earthquake, the authors want to plot the data on a map of the entire world. Additionally, they want to evaluate the effectiveness of the model and classify the earthquake magnitudes.

## What changes would you recommend?

1. If it is practicable, they could employ a user operated graphical interface that allow users to choose regions on a globe map and obtain information about that particular region.
2. The map should include the positions of the tectonic plates and earthquake epicentres so that users may quickly identify seismically vulnerable regions.
3. With the aid of current data, the authors can forecast when an area would experience earthquakes(As in a prediction model)Â  Additionally, after classifying them, the authors can offer recommendations for regions having earthquakes of a high magnitude which in turn can help save lives and help create a better system to help in times of distress.
