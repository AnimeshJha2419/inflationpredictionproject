Project: Detection and Visualization of Earthquake Data with respect to Tectonic Plates Names
Name: Animesh Kumar Jha

-------

## Provide a brief description of the project
The project deals with visualization and detection of earthquakes with respect to Continent, Tectonic Plate and Country to find the epicenter's coordinates and specify the earthquake prone zones. The authors would like to visualize the data on a world map and use multiple linear regression technique to predict the earthquake's magnitude. They would also like to categorize the magnitudes of the earthquakes and check the model performance.

## What changes would you recommend?

1. They could use graphical visuals if possible where the user can select areas on the world map and can get details of the particular area they wish to know about. Along with this the map should contain the tectonic plates and the epicenters on the map so that the user can easily identify the areas that are earthquake prone.
2. The authors can utilize the recent data and predict the timeframe in which a particular area experiences earthquakes. Along with this the authors can provide suggestions for areas with high magnitude earthquakes after classifying them.

## What is the current progress of this project?
