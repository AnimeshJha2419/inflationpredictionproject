Project: Optimizing Suntran rider opportunity in low-income neighborhoods
(https://github.com/ISTA421INFO521/final-project-natemart) by Nathaniel Martin
Name: Abhiraj Rana

## Provide a brief description of the project
This project aims to investigate and assemble a model on how the schedule for the Suntrans
may be made to run as many buses as possible throughout the day in low-income communities
by using reinforcement learning to optimize Suntran&#39;s timetables. The authors&#39; main focus is on
utilizing reinforcement learning as a main tool to understand how certain agents operate within
contexts in order to maximize a cumulative reward (model -efficiency).

## What changes would you recommend?
_Replace with your answer_
1. I would suggest the author explore Actor-Critics method for deep learning (RL) project, which
aims to take advantage of all the necessary data from both value-based and policy-based RL
methods while eliminating all their drawbacks.
2. If workable author deep Q-learning (DQN) method created as a neural network as an
alternative to the Q-table (with better efficiency), which has proven to be successful
performance for similar situations. The values of stateâ€“action pairs must be learned, and then
these action values should be used directly to implement the selected actions.
