## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#load dataset
dataset <- read.csv("Data.csv")

head(dataset)
#check dimensions of data set
dim(dataset)
# Get the structure of data set(We could have also used glimpse() here but structure function is easier to read)
str(dataset)
```
```{r}
#summary of data 
summary(dataset)
#numerical characteristics from the summary, along with missing values, additional quantile data, and an inline histogram for each variable
skimmed_dataset = skim(dataset)
skimmed_dataset

#DataExplorer::create_report(dataset)
```
